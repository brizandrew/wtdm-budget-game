# The WTDM Budget Game

The WTDM Budget Game is an interactive made for an episode of [We're The Damn Millennials](http://www.wuft.org/wtdm/) about the budget. In the episode, journalists asked millennials to divide 100 pennies into different cups. Each cup represented a different category of government spending such as "Military" or "Education." After participants divided their dollar, they were shown how similar their budget is to the federal budget.

My game allows listeners to play a version of this game also. They can drag the bars to allocate more or less money to that category, and then hit finish to see how their budget compares to the federal budget.
